A port scanner is a software application program that scans a server or a network for open ports. It is a method of determining which ports on a network are open and could be receiving or sending data. Port scanning is a process for sending packets to specific ports on a host and analyzing responses to identify vulnerabilities.

How Does it Work?

Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports on a network, which can be used to determine the services running on a server or network device. It is a common technique used by network administrators to troubleshoot network issues, identify vulnerabilities, and detect potential security threats.

Types of Port Scanners

There are different types of port scanners, including:

TCP Port Scanner: Scans for open TCP ports.
UDP Port Scanner: Scans for open UDP ports.
SYN Port Scanner: Scans for open TCP ports using the SYN packet.
ACK Port Scanner: Scans for open TCP ports using the ACK packet.
Port Scanning Tools

There are many port scanning tools available, including:

Nmap: A popular and widely used port scanning tool.
OpenVAS: An open-source vulnerability scanner that includes port scanning capabilities.
** Nessus**: A commercial vulnerability scanner that includes port scanning capabilities.
Conclusion

In summary, a port scanner is a software application program that scans a server or a network for open ports. It is a method of determining which ports on a network are open and could be receiving or sending data. Port scanning is a process for sending packets to specific ports on a host and analyzing responses to identify vulnerabilities.
